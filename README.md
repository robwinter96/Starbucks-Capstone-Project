# Predicting Offer Views: How Random Forest Classifiers Boost Starbucks Marketing Campaigns

## Overview
This report presents a study that aimed to predict whether users of the Starbucks app will view offers if they are sent to them. 3 classifier models were trialled to make these predictions which included Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor. The results of this study have the potential to greatly improve the effectiveness of marketing campaigns for businesses like Starbucks.

## Summary of Results
The results of the analysis showed that the Logistic Regression performed the best, with a recall score of 92%, followed by Random Forest Classifier with a recall score of 90% and k-Nearest Neighbors with a recall score of 89%.Â 

Looking to the future, an improvement could be made by adding further steps to this project which could predict the affect on additional revenue the selected offer may have on the user.
