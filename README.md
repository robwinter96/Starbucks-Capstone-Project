# Predicting Offer Views: How Random Forest Classifiers Boost Starbucks Marketing Campaigns

## Overview
This report presents a study that aimed to predict whether users of the Starbucks app will view offers if they are sent to them. 3 classifier models were trialled to make these predictions which included Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor. The results of this study have the potential to greatly improve the effectiveness of marketing campaigns for businesses like Starbucks.

## Summary of Results
The results of the analysis showed that the Random Forest Classifier performed the best, with a recall score of 99.7%, followed by k-Nearest Neighbors with a recall score of 98.3 % and Logistic Regression with a recall score of 98.2%. It was concluded that the Random Forest Classifier is the most suitable model for this particular task due to its ability to handle a large number of input variables and its higher accuracy rate.Â 

However, an improvement could be made by adding further steps to this project which could predict the affect on additional revenue the selected offer may have on the user. If we continued with this, Logistic Regression would provide a faster initial prediction whilst maintaining a comparable recall score.
